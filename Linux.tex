NANO(1)                     General Commands Manual                    NANO(1)

NAME
       nano - Nano's ANOther editor, an enhanced free Pico clone

SYNOPSIS
       nano [options] [[+line,column] file]...

DESCRIPTION
       nano  is  a small, free and friendly editor which aims to replace Pico,
       the default editor included in the non-free Pine package.   On  top  of
       copying  Pico's  look  and  feel, nano also implements some missing (or
       disabled by default) features in Pico, such as "search and replace" and
       "go to line and column number".

Exploring the history:

by typing "ctrl+r" you will be prompted to introduce text which bash 
will use to make a search in the list of commands you have typed previously.
That list is saved in the .bash\_history file in your home directory.  

One can control the behavior of the history file by setting environment variables
in the .bashrc file as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
export HISTCONTROL=erasedups
export HISTSIZE=100000
export HISTFILESIZE=100000
shopt -s histappend

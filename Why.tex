	\begin{itemize}
		\item	Computations take too long time
			\begin{itemize}
				\item	Use an already parallelized software
				\item	Doing it yourself
					\begin{itemize}
						\item	Doing it yourself\\
								- Run each instance on a separate core\\
								- If inside a loop, maybe suitable for
										simple parallelization
						\item	More complex problems requires more explicit
								parallel programming
					\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
		\item	Use your computer for other things
		\item	Requires a lot of memory (up to 256 GB main memory)
		\item	Solve larger (more interesting/realistic) problems
	\end{itemize}

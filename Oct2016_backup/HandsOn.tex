		\item	Log in to Abisko.
		\item	Go to the parallel file system.
		\item	Copy executable (threaded program)and submit file:\\
				\texttt{cp \~{}mr/Public/mandel .}\\
				\texttt{cp \~{}mr/Public/submit .}
		\item	Put the submit file into the batch queue.
		\item	Look at the queue.
		\item	Where did the output from the program go?
		\item	Run on 12 cores instead.
				Does it run twice as fast?
		\item	The program creates a picture on a file (\texttt{mandel.ppm})
				as output.
				Try looking at it (e.g. using the command \texttt{display}).
